# Remove AI code slop

Check the diff against the pull request's target branch, or the repository's default branch when no pull request exists. Remove AI-generated slop introduced in the branch.

## Focus Areas

- Extra comments that are unnecessary or inconsistent with local style
- Defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for trusted code paths
- Casts to `any` used only to bypass type issues
- Deeply nested code that should be simplified with early returns
- Other patterns inconsistent with the file and surrounding codebase

## Guardrails

- Keep behavior unchanged unless fixing a clear bug.
- Prefer minimal, focused edits over broad rewrites.
- Keep the final summary concise (1-3 sentences).
